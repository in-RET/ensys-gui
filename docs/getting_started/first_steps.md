As new user you doesn't find any project and scenarios. How you create and simulate is part of the next step.

The dashboard shows a navigation bar on top. On the right you can find a list of links and the dropdown menu for managing your account. On the left is the logo from "EnSys" which is also the homebutton.

On the bottom menubar you can find various links to information about the developer, our github repository, use cases which you can use to create scenarios, a short FAQ and legal notices like the imprint, privacy and license of the software.
